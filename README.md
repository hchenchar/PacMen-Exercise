# PacMen-Exercise
Description of Project: This project manipulates PacMan images to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction. This project is intended to assist with learning how to control the Document Object Model.

How to Run: Save the file to your system by downloading the index.html file in this repository. After saving, drag and drop the file onto your browser. Before beginning the animation, click on the button labeled "Add PacMan" to add as man PacMen to the screen as you would like. Once you have added as many PacMen as you prefer, click on the buttom labeled "Start Game" to prompt the PacMen images to move. The PacMen images will move on the screen and change directions as they collide with the sides of the webpage.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Looking ahead, I would like to allow for additional programming that allows the PacMen to move in additional directions (i.e. diagionally, north, south). I would also like to manipulate the images to change directions randomly, instead of being prompted to change directions once they collide with the sides of the webpage.
